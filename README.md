# Server Communicator

## Descriptions
Allows for a server and client to talk to one another with the help of java server libraries. Also uses JFrame to enhance the text display of the communication.

## Installation
Download the two files, ChatServer and ChatUser and run the files seperately in a Java IDE, preferably not an online one.
Please run the server first and then the user program. When the user exits you will have to restart everything...

## Roadmap
I hope to fully allow for the two computers to talk to each, currently I only have access to one computer to run the program. 

## Project status
Project currently under construction. This is a beta version which has only been tested on one computer.
