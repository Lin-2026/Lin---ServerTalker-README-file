# Server Communicator

## Descriptions
Allows for a server and client to talk to one another with the help of Java server libraries. Also uses JFrame to enhance the text display of the communication. The server computer has the ability to clear the chat for both the server and the user side. This program also allows for a simple "Enter to chat" system where the client simply has to press the "enter" key on their keyboard.

## Installation
Download the two files, ChatServer and ChatUser and run the files seperately in a Java IDE, preferably not an online one.
Please run the server first and then the user program. When the user exits you will have to restart everything...

## Usage
Allows for two instances of Java programs to talk to each other using a main server computer and an user computer. This program offers an admin login feature which requires a password.

## Roadmap
I hope to fully allow for the two computers to talk to each, currently I only have access to one computer to run the program. 

## Project status
Project currently under construction. This is a beta version which has only been tested on one computer.
